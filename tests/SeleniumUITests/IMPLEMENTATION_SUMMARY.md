# eShopOnWeb - Selenium UI Tests Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive set of end-to-end UI tests using Selenium WebDriver for the eShopOnWeb application. The tests are designed to validate critical user workflows through the browser interface.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Project Structure
- **New Test Project**: `tests/SeleniumUITests/`
- **Added to Solution**: Integrated into `eShopOnWeb.sln`
- **Dependencies Added**: Selenium WebDriver, Chrome Driver, and support packages
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration with environment variable support

### 2. Test Infrastructure
- **BaseSeleniumTest**: Abstract base class handling WebDriver setup, configuration, and cleanup
- **Browser Configuration**: Chrome with headless support, optimized for CI/CD environments
- **Wait Strategies**: Proper explicit waits and element detection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and resource cleanup

### 3. Page Object Model
Well-structured page objects for maintainable test code:
- **HomePage**: Catalog interactions, product selection, navigation
- **LoginPage**: Authentication flows and form validation
- **BasketPage**: Shopping cart operations and quantity management
- **CheckoutPage**: Purchase flow and payment interactions

### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage (32 Tests Total)

#### Home Page Tests (7 tests)
- Home page loading and product catalog display
- Navigation element validation
- Product addition to basket
- Product filtering by brand/type
- Navigation to basket and login pages

#### Authentication Tests (6 tests)
- Login page functionality
- Successful authentication with valid credentials
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Empty field validation
- Navigation flows
- "Remember Me" functionality

#### Basket Tests (7 tests)
- Basket page loading and empty state handling
- Product addition flow from home page
- Quantity updates and item removal
- Navigation between basket and other pages
- Checkout initiation

#### Checkout Tests (6 tests)
- Checkout page with and without items
- Authentication requirements for checkout
- Complete authenticated checkout flow
- Navigation between checkout and basket
- Payment button functionality

#### End-to-End Tests (6 tests)
- Complete purchase workflows
- Multi-product shopping scenarios
- Basket manipulation workflows
- Navigation flow testing
- Product filtering end-to-end

## Key Features

### ✅ Browser Automation
- Chrome WebDriver with automated driver management
- Headless execution for CI/CD environments
- Configurable browser options and timeouts

### ✅ Test Configuration
- Environment-specific settings via `appsettings.json`
- Override capability through environment variables
- Configurable base URL for different environments

### ✅ Robust Wait Strategies
- Explicit waits for element availability
- Custom wait conditions for complex interactions
- Timeout management for reliable test execution

### ✅ Page Object Pattern
- Maintainable and reusable page interactions
- Separation of test logic from page structure
- Easy maintenance when UI changes

### ✅ Comprehensive Coverage
- All major user workflows tested
- Both positive and negative test scenarios
- Error handling and edge case validation

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
1. .NET 8.0 SDK
2. Google Chrome browser
3. eShopOnWeb application running (default: https://localhost:5001)

### Run All Tests
```bash
dotnet test tests/SeleniumUITests/SeleniumUITests.csproj
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Home page tests only
dotnet test tests/SeleniumUITests/SeleniumUITests.csproj --filter "ClassName=Microsoft.eShopWeb.SeleniumUITests.Tests.HomePageTests"

# Authentication tests only
dotnet test tests/SeleniumUITests/SeleniumUITests.csproj --filter "ClassName=Microsoft.eShopWeb.SeleniumUITests.Tests.AuthenticationTests"
```

### Configuration Options
```json
{
  "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:5001",
  "Selenium": {
    "Headless": "true",
    "ImplicitWaitSeconds": "10",
    "ExplicitWaitSeconds": "15"
  },
  "TestUsers": {
    "DefaultUser": {
      "Email": "demouser@microsoft.com",
      "Password": "Pass@word1"
    }
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Ready

The tests are designed for automated execution:
- **Headless Mode**: Runs without UI in CI environments
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects CI environment
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of browser resources
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Adjustable for different environments
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Clear test output and failure reporting

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Validates actual user workflows through the browser
2. **Regression Testing**: Catches UI and integration issues early
3. **User Experience**: Ensures the application works from a user perspective
4. **Maintainable**: Page Object Model makes tests easy to maintain
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new tests and extend coverage
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Ready for automated build pipelines

This implementation provides a solid foundation for UI testing and can be extended to cover additional scenarios as needed.
